Our tool simplifies the process of reviewing and validating your Google Tag Manager (GTM) configuration. 

### Use it to:

- 🔍 **Get a summary** of the tags firing in your GTM container.
- 📊 **Check platform tracking IDs** (e.g., Facebook Pixel, GA4, TikTok Pixel) to ensure alignment with your measurement plan and quickly catch any misconfigurations.
- 🚨 **Detect multiple IDs** being used across tags (e.g., multiple Facebook accounts used incorrectly).
- 🔄 **Identify redundant Universal Analytics (UA) tags**.
- ❗ **Flag duplicate Google Conversion Tags**, which might indicate incorrect ID usage.
- 🌐 **Examine Floodlight tag usage** and detect duplicates.

# 🚀 **Getting Started**

1. **Export** your GTM configuration (Google Tag Manager > Admin > Export Container).
2. **Upload** the `.json` file to the field below.
3. **Review your setup*** using the various analyses

Tip: We can **analyse** both published and draft workspaces to help you spot-check and verify your setup before publishing.
