***Cut through the noise. Spot the issues. Hit publish with confidence.***

Ever feel like Google Tag Manager is out to get you? Yeah, weâ€™ve all been there.  

When someone else (looking at you, third-party agencies) makes changes, and youâ€™re stuck making sure everythingâ€™s perfect before you hit publishâ€”itâ€™s stressful.

**Thatâ€™s where our GTM Auditor steps in.**

It highlights all the weird stuffâ€”duplicate tags, wrong tracking IDs, misconfigurationsâ€”so you can clean up the mess before it becomes a real problem.

No deep technical dives needed, just a quicker way to make sure your setup is ready to go.

Ready to roll? Letâ€™s start by uploading your GTM container!

# ðŸš€ **Getting Started**

1. **Export** your GTM configuration (Google Tag Manager > Admin > Export Container).
2. **Upload** the `.json` file to the field below.
3. **Review the findings**

Tip: We can process draft workspaces to help you spot-check and verify your setup before publishing.
